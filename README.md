# KernelSU build tester for non-GKI/GKI1 Kernel

## Introductions

- Since KernelSU v1.0.0, the support for non-GKI/GKI1 kernel has been deprecated. Thus, causing so a lot of KernelSU forks to restore back the legacy support for it.
- This repository's main goal is to test compilation status on old/legacy kernel, for easier older kernel compatibility debug while adding a new features into the fork.
